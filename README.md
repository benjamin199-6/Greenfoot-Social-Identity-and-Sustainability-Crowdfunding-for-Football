# Social Identity and Sustainability Crowdfunding

This repository contains the code for the Social Identity and Sustainability Crowdfunding survey conducted using Qualtrics.

## Summary

This project involves creating a survey to study the relationship between social identity and sustainability in the context of crowdfunding. The survey is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is designed to be hosted on the Qualtrics platform.

## Description

The survey includes questions that explore participants' social identities and their willingness to support sustainable crowdfunding projects. The code is structured as follows:

- The folder `Investment Game` contains the code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for the main experiment.
- The folder `Socio Economics` contains the code for the income question.
- The folder `Norms` contains the modified code for the norm elicitation task developed by Dimant (2022).
- `qualtrics.qsf` - The complete Qualtrics survey file.

## Usage

The code is for free use and we do not guarantee that it will work.
